    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This sirloin steak recipe is served with very garlicky butter that makes this steak melt-in-your-mouth wonderful! I have never tasted any other steak that came even close to this recipe. If you are having steak, don't skimp on flavor to save a few calories.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <il>1/2 cup butter</il>
        <il>4 cloves garlic, minced</il>
        <il>2 teaspoons garlic powder</il>
        <il>4 pounds beef top sirloin steaks</il>
        <il>Salt and pepper</il>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <il>Gather all ingredients. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</il>
        <il> Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.</il>
        <il> Stir in minced garlic and garlic powder. Set aside.</il>
        <il> Season both sides of each steak with salt and pepper.</il>
        <il>Place steaks on preheated grill and cook 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium doneness.</il>
        <il>Transfer steaks to warmed plates; brush the tops liberally with garlic butter and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.</il>
    </ol>
